# Skills
# Organizational leadership
- skill: Technical
  description: |
    My deepest technical expertise is in Ruby (and Ruby on Rails), but at this phase of my career, I'm comfortable in a vast array of frameworks, methodologies, deployment platforms, databases, infrastructure and automation tools, monitoring platforms. In an abstract sense, I learn very quickly; given my existing foundation, almost nothing is unapproachable.

# Communications strategy
- skill: Soft skills
  description: |
    I write very well, and have extensive experience communicating technical topics to less-technical audiences. I'm adept at unpacking problem spaces and identifying high-leverage opportunities.
